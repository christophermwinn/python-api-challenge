UTA Data Bootcamp- Module 6 Challenge

I spent hours and hoursstruggling with the Weather API.  I kept 
getting the City not found message, meaning that there were errors.
I wasn't able to return data for any cities.  I printed the 
cities to make sure something was there (beyond the count).
Also double checked the api key, and I printed that at one
point.

Obviously, I wasn't able to get very far with the assignment,
since everything was based on this initial data pull.  I had a 
few questions about resubmitting the assignment- what is the grade
penalty for resubmitting?  And is there a time limit for resubmission?
I'd like to complete it, just for my own knowledge, but this might
be one I skip.

Hoping happier challenges are ahead...

Late breaking update-
I just received the following email from the API:
Your OpenWeatherMap API key 469e007e7e8ee0761609b50150ffe155 is temporary blocked due to the continual sufficient exceeding of the calls per minute limit by performing 609 requests within a minute but the limit for the Free account is 60 rpm.

I got this about an hour ago, so I'm not sure if any of my attempts at debugging after that time were successful.  
Obviously, I was getting through to the API.  Will try again.
