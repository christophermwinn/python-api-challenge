UTA Data Bootcamp- Module 6 Challenge

I spent hours struggling with the Weather API.  I kept getting
the City not found message, meaning that there were errors.
I wasn't able to return data for any cities.  I printed the 
cities to make sure something was there (beyond the count).
Also double checked the api key, and I printed that at one
point.

Obviously, I wasn't able to get very far with the assignment,
since everything was based on this initial data pull.  I had a 
few questions about resubmitting the assignment- what is the grade
penalty for resubmitting?  And is there a time limit for resubmission?
I'd like to complete it, just for my own knowledge, but this might
be one I skip.

Hoping happier challenges are ahead...
